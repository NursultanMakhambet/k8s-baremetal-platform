# Prepare nodes before Kubespray. Use --tags to run only parts:
#   --tags k8s      firewall (etcd/Kubernetes ports)
#   --tags dns      (add later)
#   --tags ntp      (add later)
# No tags = run all.

- name: Include firewall tasks
  include_tasks: firewall.yml
  tags: [k8s, firewall]

# Add more includes here with their own tags, e.g.:
# - name: Include DNS tasks
#   include_tasks: dns.yml
#   tags: [dns]
